            <p>In the beginning there was chaos. 
         The three golden goddesses descended upon the chaos.
          Din the godess of power created the world, the ground, and its structure. 
         Nayru the goddess of wisdom created the law and the order of the world.
         Farore the goddess of courage created all of the living beings.
          When they were finished the goddesses acended back onto the heavens.
          At the place of there departure the godesses left behind three golden triangles of immence power. This location became known as the sacred realm.
         They also left the protecion of the triforce to the new goddess of the land: Hylia.
        The triforce was in safe hands as only mortals could wield it therefore the goddess hylia in her goddess form could not.
        When word of the triforce broke out war was started. The demon king demise who arrised from a fissure in the ground with his army saught to take control of the triforce.
         Hylia fought to protect the triforce the land and all its inhabittans. At the end of the great war she sealed demise in the ground as a broken piece of himself.
    Knowing that demise would eventually break free, the goddess hylia took to the skies with parts of the ground and some of its inhabitants, the hylians
    Also knowing that she could not use the triforce herself she concocted a plan. She gave up her form and became the hylian Zelda. She had also chosen a hero with true courage to combat
    and eventually defeat the demon king. <br>The hero was known as Link who would eventually weild the sword that seals the darkness. This is only the beginning.<br>
